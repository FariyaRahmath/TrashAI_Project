### TrashAI_Project
# Installation and File Download
Uninstall all the Python IDLE, Jupyter, any local servers (like WampServer) if it is already installed in your system/ laptop.
Then, install the Python IDLE and WampServer that I have given in the main branch.
There are 2 more branches in addition to the main branch - Training and Testing branches.
Download all the files and folders of the Training and Testing branches as well.
Keep 2 separate folders in your systems for the Training and Testing branches' files and folders.

# Executing the Project
